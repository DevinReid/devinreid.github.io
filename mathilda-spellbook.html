  <h1>üï∑Ô∏è Collection Highlight: The Cult of Mathilda Apprentice's Kit</h1>

  <p><em>
    "Join the Cat Captain, Felix Fenclaw, and the enchantress, Fiona Faund, as they embark on a quest to find The Golden Portal, an ancient ruin lost to time.""</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Fenclaw & Faund</strong> is a fantasy fashion universe with original characters, narrative design, and physical merchandise. We blend fantasy storytelling with product design; and The Cult of Mathilda is one of our most ambitious narrative product collections.
  </p>

  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>
    The Cult of Mathilda story follows Felix, Fiona, and the Swordfish crew as they battle through shadows, spells, and sinister plots to reach the mythical Golden Portal. Along the way, they clash with the deadly Jeweler‚Äôs Guild and uncover a secret society of spider-worshippers devoted to the Interdimensional Spider Queen.
  </p>

  <h2>The Product</h2>
  <p>
    The Apprentice's Kit brings this fantasy to life through a spellcasting bundle designed for tabletop gamers, collectors, and occult enthusiasts alike.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A handcrafted spellbook filled with original incantations, ritual ingredients, and mystical illustrations; with TTRPG-ready roleplay mechanics woven into each spell.</li>
    <li>A custom-designed set of metal runic dice, dubbed <em>The Dice of Destiny</em>; used to generate randomized spellcasting results and combos.</li>
    <li>A leather pouch etched with cult iconography; designed to hold your dice in arcane style.</li>
    <li>And a printed storybook introducing the lore, characters, and world of Mathilda‚Äôs cult.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Did</h2>
  <p>
    I co-wrote the spellbook with Tess Goodwin, a writer with deep knowledge of magical systems. I structured the content, added clarity, and wrote all the roleplaying mechanics to make each spell playable and game-friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I designed the metal dice in AutoCAD and developed spec sheets for both the dice and all packaging elements. I also created the Cult of Mathilda logo and managed all formatting and layout for printing.
  </p>
  <p>
    We worked with four international vendors:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two book printers; one for the spellbook, and another for the lore booklet</li>
    <li>A dice casting manufacturer for the runic metal dice</li>
    <li>A leather goods supplier for the pouch</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  I coordinated final assembly by having all components shipped to one central vendor for packaging and fulfillment. Our launch at San Diego Comic-Con was locked in stone, so we had to move fast and smart. To hit the deadline, I made the call to split printing between two separate book vendors; one for the spellbook and another for the storybook; so they could run in parallel and shave days off production. It added a bit of complexity, but it bought us the time we needed without compromising print quality.
</p>

<p>
  The dice were another beast entirely. I worked directly with a metal casting vendor overseas, and after some back-and-forth negotiations, I secured a large MOQ discount that let us scale up the dice run for almost half the original price. That savings gave us breathing room in the budget to hire layout help and pay for faster shipping, which made the whole package come together just in time.
</p>

<p>
  Every piece; the books, the dice, the pouch; was produced by a different manufacturer. I coordinated the logistics so everything landed at one central hub for packaging, QC, and distribution. It was a classic example of creative production meets logistical challenge, and we pulled it off on time.
</p>

  <h2>The Result</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a personal favorite because it‚Äôs a perfect example of product development meeting creative direction, and really felt like a culmination of my skillset. From concept to delivery, I wore every hat; project manager, purchasing lead, writer, designer, and operations coordinator. It might not seem huge, but this was one of my top accomplishments I can remember, up there with going to Antarctica. I still get a rush just thinking about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have sold about half of them so far, which has been great, but we still have another half to go. I am thinking about making an app in python that finds all of the book shops and gaming stores in America to help our marketing/sales teams boost our wholesale accounts? With a little spiders's luck, Should be fun!
  </p>

  <h4>All hail the Spider Queen!</h4>
