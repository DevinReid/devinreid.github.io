  <h1>💎 Adaween, the Gem of the Jungle</h1>

  <p><em>
    “In an exhilarating tale of adventure and cunning, Felix, Fiona, and their crew infiltrate the notorious Jeweler’s Guild to steal a signet ring that might just unlock the secrets of the Golden Portal.”
  </em></p>

  <p>
    This is the story behind one of our most beautifully executed products—the <strong>Jeweler’s Guild Signet Ring</strong>. And it’s also a little story about what happens when you think you can skip a tech pack. (Spoiler: You can’t.)
  </p>

  <h2>The World of Adaween</h2>
  <p>
    Adaween is this wild jungle city I dreamed up with the team—dense, dripping with mystery, and totally run by an underground crime syndicate known as the Jeweler’s Guild. It’s the kind of place where everything gleams, but you don’t want to turn your back on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our story, Felix and Fiona break into this gem-studded world to steal a guildmaster’s signet ring, a key that leads them closer to the mythical Golden Portal. I loved the idea of a single piece of jewelry that wasn’t just symbolic—it was <em>functional</em>, dangerous, and a little magical.
  </p>

  <h2>Designing the Ring</h2>
  <p>
    I designed the ring in AutoCAD, and I was proud of how simple and solid it was—engraved lines, a big pyramid amethyst, clean lines. So I didn’t make a tech pack. Turns out, that was my first mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first sample came back with hot pink enamel in the engraving—because I had used that color in the mockup to <em>show</em> the pattern. They thought that was part of the design. Lesson learned: always explain your colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second sample was better, but the stone wasn’t tall enough. Time was tight—Chinese New Year was looming, which meant a month-long production stop if we didn’t move fast. So I did what any reasonable person under pressure would do: juggle three vendors and try to time every moving part.
  </p>

  <h2>Production on a Clock</h2>
  <p>
    We had three vendors in China: one for the ring, one for the wooden box, and one for the printed storybook. Getting the box right without a physical sample was a challenge. I had them start with a size 12 ring mold and send me the precise measurements the second it was cast. I forwarded that to the box maker so we could get a sample made in time. It worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    We kept that size 12 sample around the office. It's massive. I always wondered who even wears a 12, and then we started selling tons of size 11s and 12s. Now we even offer 13s and 14s. Apparently, there’s a whole group of fantasy-loving folks with giant hands, and I love them.
  </p>

  <h2>The Ring Today</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve worn that same sample ring on my pointer finger for three years now. It’s held up <em>incredibly</em> well—barely faded, just a little chipped in the stone (which honestly makes it look cooler). That’s the beauty of electroplated stainless steel when it’s done right. It’s not cheap junk; it’s got staying power.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my favorite things I learned during this project was from a jeweler at the LA Art Show. They said if you make the band flat on the sides—like square instead of round—it won’t spin on your finger and ends up way more comfortable. They were right. This ring is big and heavy, and you barely feel it. I kind of love that it could double as a weapon, too. In the story, the mob boss punches people with it. Multifunctional fashion.
  </p>

  <h2>The Book</h2>
  <p>
    The kit includes a little printed zine called <strong>“Adaween, Gem of the Jungle.”</strong> It’s a classic heist story—locked doors, hidden treasure, the crew sneaking into enemy territory. Honestly, I had a blast helping write that. It ties the whole product together. You’re not just buying a ring—you’re stepping into the story.
  </p>

  <h2>The End (for Now)</h2>
  <p>
    This was one of those projects where everything <em>almost</em> fell apart, and then somehow came together even better than planned. We made the deadline. The ring turned out beautifully. The story is solid. And I still wear the thing every day. That’s what I love about this kind of work—it’s design, it’s logistics, it’s magic.
