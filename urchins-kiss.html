  <h2><p style="text-align: center;">My Journey</p></h2>
  <p>
    I met my wife and her best friend because of music festivals many moons ago, we were both doing event work on opposite sides of the country. We were friends on the internet for a long time, bnut when I met her, I was met by a scent that many others have stuck in their minds to this day. <strong>Fairy Magic</strong>, is what they called it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The two made little travel sized bottles of the once secret formula in their aparmtnet in ktown, making small batches using materials sourced from a local perfume shop next to the goodwill in Inglewood.  They both worked in Nightlife in LA and passing them sround at clubs and selling them out of their purses at events. Everyone back then knew their scent, it was honestly legendary.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The blend of patchouli and the rare demascus rose instantly brings me back to that first night I met her bartending at an exclusive Mixmag event. Scent is a curious thing, isnt it? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways later on, when I was working with Fenclaw, They asked me to come up with some products for a new collection, pirate / magic themed. I had already written the story, introduced a bartender who was secretly a witch, Fiona Faund, who used her powers of enchantment to trick her patrons into giving them all of their coin and valuable trinkets, while they only remember a wild night and a nasty hangover.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had a scene, I wrote this,
  </p>
  <blockquote><em>
    Before they could even speak, an effervescent cloud of jade mist burst from the pair of gem studded goblets, wandering quickly into their lungs. The two sailors, rowdy and excited to be on land after weeks at sea, looked curiously at their steaming drinks. Any tension the men felt was gone now, and the sailors looked at Fiona with glazed eyes, relaxed, and smiled.
  </em></blockquote>
  <p>
    and my editor asked me, "What do you think that smells like?" being silly, "You know, having magic in your nose"
  </p>
  <p>
    I thought about it for a moment and knew exactly what it smelled like: <strong>Fairy Magic</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We worked with my wife to bottle the scent and sell it in our shop.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, we did what she did, getting cheap bottle from amazon, handwriting labels, mixing it in our kitchen. The woman who ran the perfume shop was very protective of her goods, especially the damascus rose oil, Patcholi you could get almost anywhere. I remember us all taking turns throughout the week going in there and order small enough amounts of the damascus rose to not raise suspicion, or she wouldnt sell it to us. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The stuff sold like hotcakes; we were really going to need to improve the product and scale production. This meant a couple things, new packaging, custom bottles that were cool and actually worked, and of course finding the elusive damascus rose supplier
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I knew it came from India</strong>, thats all we could find out from the shopkeeper before being shood away. I had some contacts in India, fabric weavers and brass smiths, but they didnt know anything about damascus rose oil.  I even sent one Indian vendor a sample of it, he could only find regular rose, which as someone with a personal connection to the scent blend, doesnt work the same. 
    I needed more information.
</p>
  <p>
    We still had to keep up with our demand, so the next week I was in the shop and the shop owner was pouring my oil, when she told me she was going out of business soon and I would need to find a new supplier. She suggested a place in Hollywood (I had already checked there: no damascus rose). I asked her what she was going to with her stock, she said she was looking for someone to take the rest of her stock off of her hands, she had over 40 gold bottles of essential oils. She was looking to sell all of them together, but didnt want to sell them individually.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I left that day with 40 gold bottles of essential oils.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get home, excited to see what information I can get from the bottle. On the label it simply said Damascus Rose and a street address in India. I gave the address to my contact India, they were able to get me a whatsapp phone  number, and the rest is history
  </p>
  <p>
    We found a glass bottle shop in china that had some really cool stuff in stock already, so we <strong>lowered our scope</strong> on the custom bottles, <strong>saving us tons of budget</strong>, and made testing alot easier. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked with a packaging manufacturer to make the gold foiled packaging. We had to get a super high MOQ but it was cheap and I figured wed use it all one day (We've ran out and ordered more since) I even designed the little swirly things on the box art myself, I'm not much of an artist, but I'm proud of it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>It is Fenclaw's best selling product</strong> by far. They get a ton of repeat customers, I think those years my wife and her best friend did on the ground at 4 am at underground techno parties has alot to do with that. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We decided to name it The Oil of the Urchins kiss, after the tavern that Fiona Faund runs, but to me it will always be 
    <strong>Fairy Magic</strong>
